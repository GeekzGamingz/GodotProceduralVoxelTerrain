# Learn
The script to mess around with is ProceduralCubes.gd. That houses all of the code in use. In the future I'd like to seperate it out into different scripts, but for now it is how it is.

# Known problems/additions
- Is only 1 layer
- Snaps to half blocks, therefore blocks overlap.
- Doesn't chunk
